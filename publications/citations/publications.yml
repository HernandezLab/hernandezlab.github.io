- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Vaccines dramatically affect an individual''s adaptive immune
    system and thus provide an excellent means to study human immunity. Upon vaccination,
    the B cells that express antibodies (Abs) that happen to bind the vaccine are
    stimulated to proliferate and undergo mutagenesis at their Ab locus. This process
    may alter the composition of B cell lineages within an individual, which are known
    collectively as the antibody repertoire (AbR). Antibodies are also highly expressed
    in whole blood, potentially enabling RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies to
    query this diversity. Less is known about the diversity of AbR responses across
    individuals to a given vaccine and if individuals tend to yield a similar response
    to the same antigenic stimulus. METHODS: Here we implement a bioinformatic pipeline
    that extracts the AbR information from a time-series RNA-seq dataset of five patients
    who were administered a seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). We harness
    the detailed time-series nature of this dataset and use methods based in functional
    data analysis (FDA) to identify the Abs that respond to the vaccine. We then design
    and implement rigorous statistical tests in order to ask whether or not these
    patients exhibit a convergent AbR response to the same TIV. RESULTS: We find that
    high-resolution time-series data can be used to help identify the Abs that respond
    to an antigenic stimulus and that this response can exhibit a convergent nature
    across patients inoculated with the same vaccine. However, correlations in AbR
    diversity among individuals prior to inoculation can confound inference of a convergent
    signal unless it is taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a framework
    to identify the elements of an AbR that respond to an antigen. This information
    could be used to understand the diversity of different immune responses in different
    individuals, as well as to gauge the effectiveness of the immune response to a
    given stimulus within an individual. We also present a framework for testing a
    convergent hypothesis between AbRs; a hypothesis that is more difficult to test
    than previously appreciated. Our discovery of a convergent signal suggests that
    similar epitopes do select for antibodies with similar sequence characteristics.'

- abstract: The role of rare alleles in complex phenotypes has been hotly debated,
    but most rare variant association tests (RVATs) do not account for the evolutionary
    forces that affect genetic architecture. Here, we use simulation and numerical
    algorithms to show that explosive population growth, as experienced by human populations,
    can dramatically increase the impact of very rare alleles on trait variance. We
    then assess the ability of RVATs to detect causal loci using simulations and human
    RNA-seq data. Surprisingly, we find that statistical performance is worst for
    phenotypes in which genetic variance is due mainly to rare alleles, and explosive
    population growth decreases power. Although many studies have attempted to identify
    causal rare variants, few have reported novel associations. This has sometimes
    been interpreted to mean that rare variants make negligible contributions to complex
    trait heritability. Our work shows that RVATs are not robust to realistic human
    evolutionary forces, so general conclusions about the impact of rare variants
    on complex traits may be premature.

- abstract: High throughput RNA sequencing technologies have provided invaluable research
    opportunities across distinct scientific domains by producing quantitative readouts
    of the transcriptional activity of both entire cellular populations and single
    cells. The majority of RNA-Seq analyses begin by mapping each experimentally produced
    sequence (i.e., read) to a set of annotated reference sequences for the organism
    of interest. For both biological and technical reasons, a significant fraction
    of reads remains unmapped. In this work we develop a read origin protocol (ROP)
    aimed at discovering the source of all reads, originated from complex RNA molecules,
    recombinant antibodies and microbial communities. Our approach can account for
    98.8% of all reads across poly(A) and ribo-depletion protocols. Furthermore, using
    ROP we show that immune profiles of asthmatic individuals are significantly different
    from the control individuals with decreased average per sample T-cell/B-cell receptor
    diversity and that immune diversity is inversely correlated with microbial load.
    This demonstrates the potential of ROP to exploit unmapped reads to better understand
    the functional mechanisms underlying the connection between immune system, microbiome,
    human gene expression, and disease etiology. The ROP pipeline is freely available

  year: 2016
- abstract: Severe infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during infancy
    is strongly associated with the development of asthma. To identify genetic variation
    that contributes to asthma following severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy,
    we sequenced the coding exons of 131 asthma candidate genes in 182 European and
    African American children with severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy using anonymous
    pools for variant discovery, and then directly genotyped a set of 190 nonsynonymous
    variants. Association testing was performed for physician-diagnosed asthma before
    the 7th birthday (asthma) using genotypes from 6,500 individuals from the Exome
    Sequencing Project (ESP) as controls to gain statistical power. In addition, among
    patients with severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy, we examined genetic associations
    with asthma, active asthma, persistent wheeze, and bronchial hyperreactivity (methacholine
    PC20) at age 6 years. We identified four rare nonsynonymous variants that were
    significantly associated with asthma following severe RSV bronchiolitis, including
    single variants in ADRB2, FLG and NCAM1 in European Americans (p = 4.6x10-4, 1.9x10-13
    and 5.0x10-5, respectively), and NOS1 in African Americans (p = 2.3x10-11). One
    of the variants was a highly functional nonsynonymous variant in ADRB2 (rs1800888),
    which was also nominally associated with asthma (p = 0.027) and active asthma
    (p = 0.013) among European Americans with severe RSV bronchiolitis without including
    the ESP. Our results suggest that rare nonsynonymous variants contribute to the
    development of asthma following severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy, notably in
    ADRB2. Additional studies are required to explore the role of rare variants in
    the etiology of asthma and asthma-related traits following severe RSV bronchiolitis.

- abstract: The 1000 Genomes Project set out to provide a comprehensive description
    of common human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to a diverse
    set of individuals from multiple populations. Here we report completion of the
    project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations
    using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing,
    and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic
    variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms
    (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural
    variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes >99%
    of SNP variants with a frequency of >1% for a variety of ancestries. We describe
    the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the
    implications for common disease studies.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: IgE is a key mediator of allergic inflammation, and its levels
    are frequently increased in patients with allergic disorders. OBJECTIVE: We sought
    to identify genetic variants associated with IgE levels in Latinos. METHODS: We
    performed a genome-wide association study and admixture mapping of total IgE levels
    in 3334 Latinos from the Genes-environments & Admixture in Latino Americans (GALA
    II) study. Replication was evaluated in 454 Latinos, 1564 European Americans,
    and 3187 African Americans from independent studies. RESULTS: We confirmed associations
    of 6 genes identified by means of previous genome-wide association studies and
    identified a novel genome-wide significant association of a polymorphism in the
    zinc finger protein 365 gene (ZNF365) with total IgE levels (rs200076616, P =
    2.3 x 10(-8)). We next identified 4 admixture mapping peaks (6p21.32-p22.1, 13p22-31,
    14q23.2, and 22q13.1) at which local African, European, and/or Native American
    ancestry was significantly associated with IgE levels. The most significant peak
    was 6p21.32-p22.1, where Native American ancestry was associated with lower IgE
    levels (P = 4.95 x 10(-8)). All but 22q13.1 were replicated in an independent
    sample of Latinos, and 2 of the peaks were replicated in African Americans (6p21.32-p22.1
    and 14q23.2). Fine mapping of 6p21.32-p22.1 identified 6 genome-wide significant
    single nucleotide polymorphisms in Latinos, 2 of which replicated in European
    Americans. Another single nucleotide polymorphism was peak-wide significant within
    14q23.2 in African Americans (rs1741099, P = 3.7 x 10(-6)) and replicated in non-African
    American samples (P = .011). CONCLUSION: We confirmed genetic associations at
    6 genes and identified novel associations within ZNF365, HLA-DQA1, and 14q23.2.
    Our results highlight the importance of studying diverse multiethnic populations
    to uncover novel loci associated with total IgE levels.'

- abstract: Ortholog detection (OD) is a lynchpin of most statistical methods in comparative
    genomics. This task involves accurately identifying genes across species that
    descend from a common ancestral sequence. OD methods comprise a wide variety of
    approaches, each with their own benefits and costs under a variety of evolutionary
    and practical scenarios. In this article, we examine the proteomes of ten mammals
    by using four methodologically distinct, rigorously filtered OD methods. In head-to-head
    comparisons, we find that these algorithms significantly outperform one another
    for 38-45% of the genes analyzed. We leverage this high complementarity through
    the development MOSAIC, or Multiple Orthologous Sequence Analysis and Integration
    by Cluster optimization, the first tool for integrating methodologically diverse
    OD methods. Relative to the four methods examined, MOSAIC more than quintuples
    the number of alignments for which all species are present while simultaneously
    maintaining or improving functional-, phylogenetic-, and sequence identity-based
    measures of ortholog quality. Further, this improvement in alignment quality yields
    more confidently aligned sites and higher levels of overall conservation, while
    simultaneously detecting of up to 180% more positively selected sites. We close
    by highlighting a MOSAIC-specific positively selected sites near the active site
    of TPSAB1, an enzyme linked to asthma, heart disease, and irritable bowel disease.
    MOSAIC alignments, source code, and full documentation are available at http://pythonhosted.org/bio-MOSAIC.

- abstract: Background. Establishing health-related causal relationships is a central
    pursuit in biomedical research. Yet, the interdependent non-linearity of biological
    systems renders causal dynamics laborious and at times impractical to disentangle.
    This pursuit is further impeded by the dearth of time series that are sufficiently
    long to observe and understand recurrent patterns of flux. However, as data generation
    costs plummet and technologies like wearable devices democratize data collection,
    we anticipate a coming surge in the availability of biomedically-relevant time
    series data. Given the life-saving potential of these burgeoning resources, it
    is critical to invest in the development of open source software tools that are
    capable of drawing meaningful insight from vast amounts of time series data. Results.
    Here we present CauseMap, the first open source implementation of convergent cross
    mapping (CCM), a method for establishing causality from long time series data
    ( greater, similar25 observations). Compared to existing time series methods,
    CCM has the advantage of being model-free and robust to unmeasured confounding
    that could otherwise induce spurious associations. CCM builds on Takens' Theorem,
    a well-established result from dynamical systems theory that requires only mild
    assumptions. This theorem allows us to reconstruct high dimensional system dynamics
    using a time series of only a single variable. These reconstructions can be thought
    of as shadows of the true causal system. If reconstructed shadows can predict
    points from opposing time series, we can infer that the corresponding variables
    are providing views of the same causal system, and so are causally related. Unlike
    traditional metrics, this test can establish the directionality of causation,
    even in the presence of feedback loops. Furthermore, since CCM can extract causal
    relationships from times series of, e.g., a single individual, it may be a valuable
    tool to personalized medicine. We implement CCM in Julia, a high-performance programming
    language designed for facile technical computing. Our software package, CauseMap,
    is platform-independent and freely available as an official Julia package. Conclusions.
    CauseMap is an efficient implementation of a state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting
    causality from time series data. We believe this tool will be a valuable resource
    for biomedical research and personalized medicine.

  title: 'CauseMap: fast inference of causality from complex time series.'

- abstract: Much recent debate has focused on the role of rare variants in complex
    phenotypes. However, it is well known that rare alleles can only contribute a
    substantial proportion of the phenotypic variance when they have much larger effect
    sizes than common variants, which is most easily explained by natural selection
    constraining trait-altering alleles to low frequency. It is also plausible that
    demographic events will influence the genetic architecture of complex traits.
    Unfortunately, most rare variant association tests do not explicitly model natural
    selection or non-equilibrium demography. Here, we develop a novel evolutionary
    model of complex traits. We perform numerical calculations and simulate phenotypes
    under this model using inferred human demographic and selection parameters. We
    show that rare variants only contribute substantially to complex traits under
    very strong assumptions about the relationship between effect size and selection
    strength. We then assess the performance of state-of-the-art rare variant tests
    using our simulations across a broad range of model parameters. Counterintuitively,
    we find that statistical power is lowest when rare variants make the greatest
    contribution to the additive variance, and that power is substantially lower under
    our model than previously studied models. While many empirical studies have attempted
    to identify causal loci using rare variant association methods, few have reported
    novel associations. Some authors have interpreted this to mean that rare variants
    contribute little to heritability, but our results show that an alternative explanation
    is that rare variant tests have less power than previously estimated.

- abstract: Mapping host-pathogen interactions has proven instrumental for understanding
    how viruses manipulate host machinery and how numerous cellular processes are
    regulated. DNA viruses such as herpesviruses have relatively large coding capacity
    and thus can target an extensive network of cellular proteins. To identify the
    host proteins hijacked by this pathogen, we systematically affinity tagged and
    purified all 89 proteins of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) from
    human cells. Mass spectrometry of this material identified over 500 virus-host
    interactions. KSHV causes AIDS-associated cancers, and its interaction network
    is enriched for proteins linked to cancer and overlaps with proteins that are
    also targeted by HIV-1. We found that the conserved KSHV protein ORF24 binds to
    RNA polymerase II and brings it to viral late promoters by mimicking and replacing
    cellular TATA-box-binding protein (TBP). This is required for herpesviral late
    gene expression, a complex and poorly understood phase of the viral lifecycle.

- abstract: Genetic simulation programs are used to model data under specified assumptions
    to facilitate the understanding and study of complex genetic systems. Standardized
    data sets generated using genetic simulation are essential for the development
    and application of novel analytical tools in genetic epidemiology studies. With
    continuing advances in high-throughput genomic technologies and generation and
    analysis of larger, more complex data sets, there is a need for updating current
    approaches in genetic simulation modeling. To provide a forum to address current
    and emerging challenges in this area, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored
    a workshop, entitled "Genetic Simulation Tools for Post-Genome Wide Association
    Studies of Complex Diseases" at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda,
    Maryland on March 11-12, 2014. The goals of the workshop were to (1) identify
    opportunities, challenges, and resource needs for the development and application
    of genetic simulation models; (2) improve the integration of tools for modeling
    and analysis of simulated data; and (3) foster collaborations to facilitate development
    and applications of genetic simulation. During the course of the meeting, the
    group identified challenges and opportunities for the science of simulation, software
    and methods development, and collaboration. This paper summarizes key discussions
    at the meeting, and highlights important challenges and opportunities to advance
    the field of genetic simulation.

  title: Genetic simulation tools for post-genome wide association studies of complex
    diseases.
  year: 2015
- abstract: Demographic events and natural selection alter patterns of genetic variation
    within populations and may play a substantial role in shaping the genetic architecture
    of complex phenotypes and disease. However, the joint impact of these basic evolutionary
    forces is often ignored in the assessment of statistical tests of association.
    Here, we provide a simulation-based framework for generating DNA sequences that
    incorporates selection and demography with flexible models for simulating phenotypic
    variation (sfs_coder). This tool also allows the user to perform locus-specific
    simulations by automatically querying annotated genomic functional elements and
    genetic maps. We demonstrate the effects of evolutionary forces on patterns of
    genetic variation by simulating recently inferred models of human selection and
    demography. We use these simulations to show that the demographic model and locus-specific
    features, such as the proportion of sites under selection, may have practical
    implications for estimating the statistical power of sequencing-based rare variant
    association tests. In particular, for some phenotype models, there may be higher
    power to detect rare variant associations in African populations compared to non-Africans,
    but power is considerably reduced in regions of the genome with rampant negative
    selection. Furthermore, we show that existing methods for simulating large samples
    based on resampling from a small set of observed haplotypes fail to recapitulate
    the distribution of rare variants in the presence of rapid population growth (as
    has been observed in several human populations).

- abstract: Haplotype-based scans to detect natural selection are useful to identify
    recent or ongoing positive selection in genomes. As both real and simulated genomic
    data sets grow larger, spanning thousands of samples and millions of markers,
    there is a need for a fast and efficient implementation of these scans for general
    use. Here, we present selscan, an efficient multithreaded application that implements
    Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH), Integrated Haplotype Score (iHS), and Cross-population
    EHH (XPEHH). selscan accepts phased genotypes in multiple formats, including TPED,
    and performs extremely well on both simulated and real data and over an order
    of magnitude faster than existing available implementations. It calculates iHS
    on chromosome 22 (22,147 loci) across 204 CEU haplotypes in 353 s on one thread
    (33 s on 16 threads) and calculates XPEHH for the same data relative to 210 YRI
    haplotypes in 578 s on one thread (52 s on 16 threads). Source code and binaries
    (Windows, OSX, and Linux) are available at https://github.com/szpiech/selscan.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Population differentiation has proved to be effective for
    identifying loci under geographically localized positive selection, and has the
    potential to identify loci subject to balancing selection. We have previously
    investigated the pattern of genetic differentiation among human populations at
    36.8 million genomic variants to identify sites in the genome showing high frequency
    differences. Here, we extend this dataset to include additional variants, survey
    sites with low levels of differentiation, and evaluate the extent to which highly
    differentiated sites are likely to result from selective or other processes. RESULTS:
    We demonstrate that while sites with low differentiation represent sampling effects
    rather than balancing selection, sites showing extremely high population differentiation
    are enriched for positive selection events and that one half may be the result
    of classic selective sweeps. Among these, we rediscover known examples, where
    we actually identify the established functional SNP, and discover novel examples
    including the genes ABCA12, CALD1 and ZNF804, which we speculate may be linked
    to adaptations in skin, calcium metabolism and defense, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
    We identify known and many novel candidate regions for geographically restricted
    positive selection, and suggest several directions for further research.'

- abstract: A major use of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 GP) data is genotype imputation
    in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we develop a method to estimate
    haplotypes from low-coverage sequencing data that can take advantage of single-nucleotide
    polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotypes on the same samples. First the SNP array
    data are phased to build a backbone (or 'scaffold') of haplotypes across each
    chromosome. We then phase the sequence data 'onto' this haplotype scaffold. This
    approach can take advantage of relatedness between sequenced and non-sequenced
    samples to improve accuracy. We use this method to create a new 1000 GP haplotype
    reference set for use by the human genetic community. Using a set of validation
    genotypes at SNP and bi-allelic indels we show that these haplotypes have lower
    genotype discordance and improved imputation performance into downstream GWAS
    samples, especially at low-frequency variants.

- abstract: Evolutionary forces shape patterns of genetic diversity within populations
    and contribute to phenotypic variation. In particular, recurrent positive selection
    has attracted significant interest in both theoretical and empirical studies.
    However, most existing theoretical models of recurrent positive selection cannot
    easily incorporate realistic confounding effects such as interference between
    selected sites, arbitrary selection schemes, and complicated demographic processes.
    It is possible to quantify the effects of arbitrarily complex evolutionary models
    by performing forward population genetic simulations, but forward simulations
    can be computationally prohibitive for large population sizes (>10(5)). A common
    approach for overcoming these computational limitations is rescaling of the most
    computationally expensive parameters, especially population size. Here, we show
    that ad hoc approaches to parameter rescaling under the recurrent hitchhiking
    model do not always provide sufficiently accurate dynamics, potentially skewing
    patterns of diversity in simulated DNA sequences. We derive an extension of the
    recurrent hitchhiking model that is appropriate for strong selection in small
    population sizes and use it to develop a method for parameter rescaling that provides
    the best possible computational performance for a given error tolerance. We perform
    a detailed theoretical analysis of the robustness of rescaling across the parameter
    space. Finally, we apply our rescaling algorithms to parameters that were previously
    inferred for Drosophila and discuss practical considerations such as interference
    between selected sites.

- abstract: Assessing the statistical significance of an observed 2x2 contingency
    table can easily be accomplished using Fisher's exact test (FET). However, if
    the cell entries are continuous or represent values inferred from a continuous
    parametric model, then FET cannot be applied. Such tables arise frequently in
    areas of biostatistical research including population genetics and evolutionary
    genomics, where cell entries are estimated by computational methods and result
    in cell entries drawn from the non-negative real line R+. Simply rounding cell
    entries to conform to the assumptions of FET is an ill-suited approach that we
    show creates problems related to both type-I and type-II errors. Pearson's chi^2
    test for independence, while technically applicable, is not often effective for
    these tables, as the test has several limiting assumptions that make application
    of this method inadvisable in many common instances (particularly with small cell
    entries). Here we develop a novel method for tables with continuous entries, which
    we term continuous Fisher's Exact Test (cFET). Through simulations, we show that
    cFET has a close-to-uniform distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis
    of independence, and more power when applied to tables where the null hypothesis
    is false (compared to FET applied to rounded cell entries). We apply cFET to an
    example from comparative genomics to confirm an overall increased evolutionary
    rate among primates compared to rodents, and identify several genes that show
    particularly elevated evolutionary rates in primates. Some of these genes exhibit
    signatures of continued positive selection along the human lineage since our divergence
    with chimpanzee 5-7 million years ago, as well as ongoing selection in modern
    humans.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The primary rescue medication to treat acute asthma exacerbation
    is the short-acting beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, there is variation
    in how well a patient responds to treatment. Although these differences might
    be due to environmental factors, there is mounting evidence for a genetic contribution
    to variability in bronchodilator response (BDR). OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic
    variation associated with bronchodilator drug response in Latino children with
    asthma. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for BDR in
    1782 Latino children with asthma using standard linear regression, adjusting for
    genetic ancestry and ethnicity, and performed replication studies in an additional
    531 Latinos. We also performed admixture mapping across the genome by testing
    for an association between local European, African, and Native American ancestry
    and BDR, adjusting for genomic ancestry and ethnicity. RESULTS: We identified
    7 genetic variants associated with BDR at a genome-wide significant threshold
    (P < 5 x 10(-8)), all of which had frequencies of less than 5%. Furthermore, we
    observed an excess of small P values driven by rare variants (frequency, <5%)
    and by variants in the proximity of solute carrier (SLC) genes. Admixture mapping
    identified 5 significant peaks; fine mapping within these peaks identified 2 rare
    variants in SLC22A15 as being associated with increased BDR in Mexicans. Quantitative
    PCR and immunohistochemistry identified SLC22A15 as being expressed in the lung
    and bronchial epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that rare variation
    contributes to individual differences in response to albuterol in Latinos, notably
    in SLC genes that include membrane transport proteins involved in the transport
    of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics. Resequencing in larger, multiethnic
    population samples and additional functional studies are required to further understand
    the role of rare variation in BDR.'

- abstract: Proteins are not monolithic entities; rather, they can contain multiple
    domains that mediate distinct interactions, and their functionality can be regulated
    through post-translational modifications at multiple distinct sites. Traditionally,
    network biology has ignored such properties of proteins and has instead examined
    either the physical interactions of whole proteins or the consequences of removing
    entire genes. In this Review, we discuss experimental and computational methods
    to increase the resolution of protein-protein, genetic and drug-gene interaction
    studies to the domain and residue levels. Such work will be crucial for using
    interaction networks to connect sequence and structural information, and to understand
    the biological consequences of disease-associated mutations, which will hopefully
    lead to more effective therapeutic strategies.

- abstract: Interpreting variants, especially noncoding ones, in the increasing number
    of personal genomes is challenging. We used patterns of polymorphisms in functionally
    annotated regions in 1092 humans to identify deleterious variants; then we experimentally
    validated candidates. We analyzed both coding and noncoding regions, with the
    former corroborating the latter. We found regions particularly sensitive to mutations
    ("ultrasensitive") and variants that are disruptive because of mechanistic effects
    on transcription-factor binding (that is, "motif-breakers"). We also found variants
    in regions with higher network centrality tend to be deleterious. Insertions and
    deletions followed a similar pattern to single-nucleotide variants, with some
    notable exceptions (e.g., certain deletions and enhancers). On the basis of these
    patterns, we developed a computational tool (FunSeq), whose application to ~90
    cancer genomes reveals nearly a hundred candidate noncoding drivers.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Regions of the genome that are under evolutionary constraint
    across multiple species have previously been used to identify functional sequences
    in the human genome. Furthermore, it is known that there is an inverse relationship
    between evolutionary constraint and the allele frequency of a mutation segregating
    in human populations, implying a direct relationship between interspecies divergence
    and fitness in humans. Here we utilise this relationship to test differences in
    the accumulation of putatively deleterious mutations both between populations
    and on the individual level. RESULTS: Using whole genome and exome sequencing
    data from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genome Project for 1,092 individuals from 14 worldwide
    populations we show that minor allele frequency (MAF) varies as a function of
    constraint around both coding regions and non-coding sites genome-wide, implying
    that negative, rather than positive, selection primarily drives the distribution
    of alleles among individuals via background selection. We find a strong relationship
    between effective population size and the depth of depression in MAF around the
    most conserved genes, suggesting that populations with smaller effective size
    are carrying more deleterious mutations, which also translates into higher genetic
    load when considering the number of putatively deleterious alleles segregating
    within each population. Finally, given the extreme richness of the data, we are
    now able to classify individual genomes by the accumulation of mutations at functional
    sites using high coverage 1000 Genomes data. Using this approach we detect differences
    between ''healthy'' individuals within populations for the distributions of putatively
    deleterious rare alleles they are carrying. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate
    the extent of background selection in the human genome and highlight the role
    of population history in shaping patterns of diversity between human individuals.
    Furthermore, we provide a framework for the utility of personal genomic data for
    the study of genetic fitness and diseases.'

- abstract: Progressive HIV infection is characterized by dysregulation of the intestinal
    immune barrier, translocation of immunostimulatory microbial products, and chronic
    systemic inflammation that is thought to drive progression of disease to AIDS.
    Elements of this pathologic process persist despite viral suppression during highly
    active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and drivers of these phenomena remain poorly
    understood. Disrupted intestinal immunity can precipitate dysbiosis that induces
    chronic inflammation in the mucosa and periphery of mice. However, putative microbial
    drivers of HIV-associated immunopathology versus recovery have not been identified
    in humans. Using high-resolution bacterial community profiling, we identified
    a dysbiotic mucosal-adherent community enriched in Proteobacteria and depleted
    of Bacteroidia members that was associated with markers of mucosal immune disruption,
    T cell activation, and chronic inflammation in HIV-infected subjects. Furthermore,
    this dysbiosis was evident among HIV-infected subjects undergoing HAART, and the
    extent of dysbiosis correlated with activity of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan
    catabolism and plasma concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6
    (IL-6), two established markers of disease progression. Gut-resident bacteria
    with capacity to catabolize tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway were found
    to be enriched in HIV-infected subjects, strongly correlated with kynurenine levels
    in HIV-infected subjects, and capable of kynurenine production in vitro. These
    observations demonstrate a link between mucosal-adherent colonic bacteria and
    immunopathogenesis during progressive HIV infection that is apparent even in the
    setting of viral suppression during HAART. This link suggests that gut-resident
    microbial populations may influence intestinal homeostasis during HIV disease.

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Identifying drivers of complex traits from the noisy signals
    of genetic variation obtained from high-throughput genome sequencing technologies
    is a central challenge faced by human geneticists today. We hypothesize that the
    variants involved in complex diseases are likely to exhibit non-neutral evolutionary
    signatures. Uncovering the evolutionary history of all variants is therefore of
    intrinsic interest for complex disease research. However, doing so necessitates
    the simultaneous elucidation of the targets of natural selection and population-specific
    demographic history. METHODS: Here we characterize the action of natural selection
    operating across complex disease categories, and use population genetic simulations
    to evaluate the expected patterns of genetic variation in large samples. We focus
    on populations that have experienced historical bottlenecks followed by explosive
    growth (consistent with many human populations), and describe the differences
    between evolutionarily deleterious mutations and those that are neutral. RESULTS:
    Genes associated with several complex disease categories exhibit stronger signatures
    of purifying selection than non-disease genes. In addition, loci identified through
    genome-wide association studies of complex traits also exhibit signatures consistent
    with being in regions recurrently targeted by purifying selection. Through simulations,
    we show that population bottlenecks and rapid growth enable deleterious rare variants
    to persist at low frequencies just as long as neutral variants, but low-frequency
    and common variants tend to be much younger than neutral variants. This has resulted
    in a large proportion of modern-day rare alleles that have a deleterious effect
    on function and that potentially contribute to disease susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS:
    The key question for sequencing-based association studies of complex traits is
    how to distinguish between deleterious and benign genetic variation. We used population
    genetic simulations to uncover patterns of genetic variation that distinguish
    these two categories, especially derived allele age, thereby providing inroads
    into novel methods for characterizing rare genetic variation driving complex diseases.'

  title: Population genetics of rare variants and complex diseases.
  year: 2013
- abstract: By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic
    variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to understand
    the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals
    from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome
    and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several
    algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38
    million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions,
    and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different
    populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency
    variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased
    by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and
    coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection,
    that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that
    each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites,
    such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource,
    which captures up to 98% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency
    of 1% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants
    in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.

- abstract: UGT2B enzymes metabolize multiple endogenous and exogenous molecules,
    including steroid hormones and clinical drugs. However, little is known about
    the inter-individual variation in gene expression and its determinants. We re-sequenced
    candidate regulatory regions and the partial coding regions (41.1 kb) of UGT2B
    genes and identified 332 genetic variants. We measured gene expression in normal
    breast and liver samples and observed different patterns. The expression levels
    varied greatly across individuals in both tissues and were significantly correlated
    with each other in liver. Genotyping of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms
    (SNPs) in the same samples and association tests between genotype and transcript
    levels identified 62 variants that were associated with at least one UGT2B mRNA
    levels in either tissue. Most of these cis-regulatory SNPs were not shared between
    tissues, suggesting that this gene family is regulated in a tissue-specific manner.
    Our results provide insight into studying the role of UGT2B variation in hormone-dependent
    cancers and drug response.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in more than 100 genes have been associated
    with asthma susceptibility, yet much of the heritability remains to be explained.
    Asthma disproportionately affects different racial and ethnic groups in the United
    States, suggesting that admixture mapping is a useful strategy to identify novel
    asthma-associated loci. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify novel asthma-associated
    loci in Latino populations using case-control admixture mapping. METHODS: We performed
    genome-wide admixture mapping by comparing levels of local Native American, European,
    and African ancestry between children with asthma and nonasthmatic control subjects
    in Puerto Rican and Mexican populations. Within candidate peaks, we performed
    allelic tests of association, controlling for differences in local ancestry. RESULTS:
    Between the 2 populations, we identified a total of 62 admixture mapping peaks
    at a P value of less than 10(-3) that were significantly enriched for previously
    identified asthma-associated genes (P= .0051). One of the peaks was statistically
    significant based on 100 permutations in the Mexican sample (6q15); however, it
    was not significant in Puerto Rican subjects. Another peak was identified at nominal
    significance in both populations (8q12); however, the association was observed
    with different ancestries. CONCLUSION: Case-control admixture mapping is a promising
    strategy for identifying novel asthma-associated loci in Latino populations and
    implicates genetic variation at 6q15 and 8q12 regions with asthma susceptibility.
    This approach might be useful for identifying regions that contribute to both
    shared and population-specific differences in asthma susceptibility.'

- abstract: To study the evolution of recombination rates in apes, we developed methodology
    to construct a fine-scale genetic map from high-throughput sequence data from
    10 Western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus. Compared to the human genetic map,
    broad-scale recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with exceptions, particularly
    in regions of chromosomal rearrangements and around the site of ancestral fusion
    in human chromosome 2. At fine scales, chimpanzee recombination is dominated by
    hotspots, which show no overlap with those of humans even though rates are similarly
    elevated around CpG islands and decreased within genes. The hotspot-specifying
    protein PRDM9 shows extensive variation among Western chimpanzees, and there is
    little evidence that any sequence motifs are enriched in hotspots. The contrasting
    locations of hotspots provide a natural experiment, which demonstrates the impact
    of recombination on base composition.

- abstract: Common variation in over 100 genes has been implicated in the risk of
    developing asthma, but the contribution of rare variants to asthma susceptibility
    remains largely unexplored. We selected nine genes that showed the strongest signatures
    of weak purifying selection from among 53 candidate asthma-associated genes, and
    we sequenced the coding exons and flanking noncoding regions in 450 asthmatic
    cases and 515 nonasthmatic controls. We observed an overall excess of p values
    <0.05 (p = 0.02), and rare variants in four genes (AGT, DPP10, IKBKAP, and IL12RB1)
    contributed to asthma susceptibility among African Americans. Rare variants in
    IL12RB1 were also associated with asthma susceptibility among European Americans,
    despite the fact that the majority of rare variants in IL12RB1 were specific to
    either one of the populations. The combined evidence of association with rare
    noncoding variants in IL12RB1 remained significant (p = 3.7 x 10(-4)) after correcting
    for multiple testing. Overall, the contribution of rare variants to asthma susceptibility
    was predominantly due to noncoding variants in sequences flanking the exons, although
    nonsynonymous rare variants in DPP10 and in IL12RB1 were associated with asthma
    in African Americans and European Americans, respectively. This study provides
    evidence that rare variants contribute to asthma susceptibility. Additional studies
    are required for testing whether prioritizing genes for resequencing on the basis
    of signatures of purifying selection is an efficient means of identifying novel
    rare variants that contribute to complex disease.

- abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a small genome and therefore relies
    heavily on the host cellular machinery to replicate. Identifying which host proteins
    and complexes come into physical contact with the viral proteins is crucial for
    a comprehensive understanding of how HIV rewires the host's cellular machinery
    during the course of infection. Here we report the use of affinity tagging and
    purification mass spectrometry to determine systematically the physical interactions
    of all 18 HIV-1 proteins and polyproteins with host proteins in two different
    human cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat). Using a quantitative scoring system that
    we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497 HIV-human protein-protein
    interactions involving 435 individual human proteins, with approximately 40% of
    the interactions being identified in both cell types. We found that the host proteins
    hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly
    conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by
    viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit
    of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. This host protein is one of eleven
    identified in this analysis that act to inhibit HIV replication. This data set
    facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery
    is manipulated during the course of HIV infection.

- abstract: Through an analysis of polymorphism within and divergence between species,
    we can hope to learn about the distribution of selective effects of mutations
    in the genome, changes in the fitness landscape that occur over time, and the
    location of sites involved in key adaptations that distinguish modern-day species.
    We introduce a novel method for the analysis of variation in selection pressures
    within and between species, spatially along the genome and temporally between
    lineages. We model codon evolution explicitly using a joint population genetics-phylogenetics
    approach that we developed for the construction of multiallelic models with mutation,
    selection, and drift. Our approach has the advantage of performing direct inference
    on coding sequences, inferring ancestral states probabilistically, utilizing allele
    frequency information, and generalizing to multiple species. We use a Bayesian
    sliding window model for intragenic variation in selection coefficients that efficiently
    combines information across sites and captures spatial clustering within the genome.
    To demonstrate the utility of the method, we infer selective pressures acting
    in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans from polymorphism and divergence data
    for 100 X-linked coding regions.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Rare coding variants constitute an important class of human
    genetic variation, but are underrepresented in current databases that are based
    on small population samples. Recent studies show that variants altering amino
    acid sequence and protein function are enriched at low variant allele frequency,
    2 to 5%, but because of insufficient sample size it is not clear if the same trend
    holds for rare variants below 1% allele frequency. RESULTS: The 1000 Genomes Exon
    Pilot Project has collected deep-coverage exon-capture data in roughly 1,000 human
    genes, for nearly 700 samples. Although medical whole-exome projects are currently
    afoot, this is still the deepest reported sampling of a large number of human
    genes with next-generation technologies. According to the goals of the 1000 Genomes
    Project, we created effective informatics pipelines to process and analyze the
    data, and discovered 12,758 exonic SNPs, 70% of them novel, and 74% below 1% allele
    frequency in the seven population samples we examined. Our analysis confirms that
    coding variants below 1% allele frequency show increased population-specificity
    and are enriched for functional variants. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a
    large step toward detecting and interpreting low frequency coding variation, clearly
    lays out technical steps for effective analysis of DNA capture data, and articulates
    functional and population properties of this important class of genetic variation.'

- abstract: Asthma is a common disease with a complex risk architecture including
    both genetic and environmental factors. We performed a meta-analysis of North
    American genome-wide association studies of asthma in 5,416 individuals with asthma
    (cases) including individuals of European American, African American or African
    Caribbean, and Latino ancestry, with replication in an additional 12,649 individuals
    from the same ethnic groups. We identified five susceptibility loci. Four were
    at previously reported loci on 17q21, near IL1RL1, TSLP and IL33, but we report
    for the first time, to our knowledge, that these loci are associated with asthma
    risk in three ethnic groups. In addition, we identified a new asthma susceptibility
    locus at PYHIN1, with the association being specific to individuals of African
    descent (P = 3.9 x 10(-9)). These results suggest that some asthma susceptibility
    loci are robust to differences in ancestry when sufficiently large samples sizes
    are investigated, and that ancestry-specific associations also contribute to the
    complex genetic architecture of asthma.

- abstract: 'SUMMARY: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing
    DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants,
    together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and
    can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on
    the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and
    has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome
    Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing
    VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general
    Perl API. AVAILABILITY: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net'

- abstract: High-throughput sequencing technology enables population-level surveys
    of human genomic variation. Here, we examine the joint allele frequency distributions
    across continental human populations and present an approach for combining complementary
    aspects of whole-genome, low-coverage data and targeted high-coverage data. We
    apply this approach to data generated by the pilot phase of the Thousand Genomes
    Project, including whole-genome 2-4x coverage data for 179 samples from HapMap
    European, Asian, and African panels as well as high-coverage target sequencing
    of the exons of 800 genes from 697 individuals in seven populations. We use the
    site frequency spectra obtained from these data to infer demographic parameters
    for an Out-of-Africa model for populations of African, European, and Asian descent
    and to predict, by a jackknife-based approach, the amount of genetic diversity
    that will be discovered as sample sizes are increased. We predict that the number
    of discovered nonsynonymous coding variants will reach 100,000 in each population
    after approximately 1,000 sequenced chromosomes per population, whereas approximately
    2,500 chromosomes will be needed for the same number of synonymous variants. Beyond
    this point, the number of segregating sites in the European and Asian panel populations
    is expected to overcome that of the African panel because of faster recent population
    growth. Overall, we find that the majority of human genomic variable sites are
    rare and exhibit little sharing among diverged populations. Our results emphasize
    that replication of disease association for specific rare genetic variants across
    diverged populations must overcome both reduced statistical power because of rarity
    and higher population divergence.

- abstract: J.B.S. Haldane proposed in 1947 that the male germline may be more mutagenic
    than the female germline. Diverse studies have supported Haldane's contention
    of a higher average mutation rate in the male germline in a variety of mammals,
    including humans. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first direct comparative
    analysis of male and female germline mutation rates from the complete genome sequences
    of two parent-offspring trios. Through extensive validation, we identified 49
    and 35 germline de novo mutations (DNMs) in two trio offspring, as well as 1,586
    non-germline DNMs arising either somatically or in the cell lines from which the
    DNA was derived. Most strikingly, in one family, we observed that 92% of germline
    DNMs were from the paternal germline, whereas, in contrast, in the other family,
    64% of DNMs were from the maternal germline. These observations suggest considerable
    variation in mutation rates within and between families.

- abstract: Oryza sativa or Asian cultivated rice is one of the major cereal grass
    species domesticated for human food use during the Neolithic. Domestication of
    this species from the wild grass Oryza rufipogon was accompanied by changes in
    several traits, including seed shattering, percent seed set, tillering, grain
    weight, and flowering time. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has identified
    three genomic regions in chromosome 3 that appear to be associated with these
    traits. We would like to study whether these regions show signatures of selection
    and whether the same genetic basis underlies the domestication of different rice
    varieties. Fragments of 88 genes spanning these three genomic regions were sequenced
    from multiple accessions of two major varietal groups in O. sativa--indica and
    tropical japonica--as well as the ancestral wild rice species O. rufipogon. In
    tropical japonica, the levels of nucleotide variation in these three QTL regions
    are significantly lower compared to genome-wide levels, and coalescent simulations
    based on a complex demographic model of rice domestication indicate that these
    patterns are consistent with selection. In contrast, there is no significant reduction
    in nucleotide diversity in the homologous regions in indica rice. These results
    suggest that there are differences in the genetic and selective basis for domestication
    between these two Asian rice varietal groups.

- abstract: Efforts to identify the genetic basis of human adaptations from polymorphism
    data have sought footprints of "classic selective sweeps" (in which a beneficial
    mutation arises and rapidly fixes in the population).Yet it remains unknown whether
    this form of natural selection was common in our evolution. We examined the evidence
    for classic sweeps in resequencing data from 179 human genomes. As expected under
    a recurrent-sweep model, we found that diversity levels decrease near exons and
    conserved noncoding regions. In contrast to expectation, however, the trough in
    diversity around human-specific amino acid substitutions is no more pronounced
    than around synonymous substitutions. Moreover, relative to the genome background,
    amino acid and putative regulatory sites are not significantly enriched in alleles
    that are highly differentiated between populations. These findings indicate that
    classic sweeps were not a dominant mode of human adaptation over the past ~250,000
    years.

- abstract: Genomic structural variants (SVs) are abundant in humans, differing from
    other forms of variation in extent, origin and functional impact. Despite progress
    in SV characterization, the nucleotide resolution architecture of most SVs remains
    unknown. We constructed a map of unbalanced SVs (that is, copy number variants)
    based on whole genome DNA sequencing data from 185 human genomes, integrating
    evidence from complementary SV discovery approaches with extensive experimental
    validations. Our map encompassed 22,025 deletions and 6,000 additional SVs, including
    insertions and tandem duplications. Most SVs (53%) were mapped to nucleotide resolution,
    which facilitated analysing their origin and functional impact. We examined numerous
    whole and partial gene deletions with a genotyping approach and observed a depletion
    of gene disruptions amongst high frequency deletions. Furthermore, we observed
    differences in the size spectra of SVs originating from distinct formation mechanisms,
    and constructed a map of SV hotspots formed by common mechanisms. Our analytical
    framework and SV map serves as a resource for sequencing-based association studies.

  title: Mapping copy number variation by population-scale genome sequencing.
  year: 2011
- abstract: Copy number variants affect both disease and normal phenotypic variation,
    but those lying within heavily duplicated, highly identical sequence have been
    difficult to assay. By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes,
    we demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for duplications as
    small as 1.9 kilobase pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies. We identified 4.1 million
    "singly unique nucleotide" positions informative in distinguishing specific copies
    and used them to genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly
    duplicated gene families. These data identify human-specific expansions in genes
    associated with brain development, reveal extensive population genetic diversity,
    and detect signatures consistent with gene conversion in the human species. Our
    approach makes ~1000 genes accessible to genetic studies of disease association.

  title: Diversity of human copy number variation and multicopy genes.
  year: 2010
- abstract: 'The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human
    genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship between
    genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project,
    designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing
    with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome
    sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing
    of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals
    from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype
    structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million
    short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which
    were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast
    majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found
    in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found
    to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes
    and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate
    how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From
    the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution
    mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore
    the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked
    reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection
    at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of
    human genetic research.'

  title: A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing.
  year: 2010
- abstract: DNA replication errors that escape polymerase proofreading and mismatch
    repair (MMR) can lead to base substitution and frameshift mutations. Such mutations
    can disrupt gene function, reduce fitness, and promote diseases such as cancer
    and are also the raw material of molecular evolution. To analyze with limited
    bias genomic features associated with DNA polymerase errors, we performed a genome-wide
    analysis of mutations that accumulate in MMR-deficient diploid lines of Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae. These lines were derived from a common ancestor and were grown for
    160 generations, with bottlenecks reducing the population to one cell every 20
    generations. We sequenced to between 8- and 20-fold coverage one wild-type and
    three mutator lines using Illumina Solexa 36-bp reads. Using an experimentally
    aware Bayesian genotype caller developed to pool experimental data across sequencing
    runs for all strains, we detected 28 heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms
    (SNPs) and 48 single-nt insertion/deletions (indels) from the data set. This method
    was evaluated on simulated data sets and found to have a very low false-positive
    rate ( approximately 6 x 10(-5)) and a false-negative rate of 0.08 within the
    unique mapping regions of the genome that contained at least sevenfold coverage.
    The heterozygous mutations identified by the Bayesian genotype caller were confirmed
    by Sanger sequencing. All of the mutations were unique to a given line, except
    for a single-nt deletion mutation which occurred independently in two lines. All
    48 indels, composed of 46 deletions and two insertions, occurred in homopolymer
    (HP) tracts [i.e., 47 poly(A) or (T) tracts, 1 poly(G) or (C) tract] between 5
    and 13 bp long. Our findings are of interest because HP tracts are present at
    high levels in the yeast genome (>77,400 for 5- to 20-nt HP tracts), and frameshift
    mutations in these regions are likely to disrupt gene function. In addition, they
    demonstrate that the mutation pattern seen previously in mismatch repair defective
    strains using a limited number of reporters holds true for the entire genome.

- abstract: 'Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating
    prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection.
    We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic
    variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute
    the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele
    Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach
    is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the
    variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps
    incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance
    values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single
    sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations
    experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions,
    migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement
    of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from
    4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We
    infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years
    ago (95% confidence interval: 40-270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic
    studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU)
    and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95% c.i.: 17-43 kya), long
    after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate
    divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95%
    c.i.: 16.3-26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration.
    Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution
    of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts
    the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations
    (YRI, CHB, CEU).'

- abstract: Analysis of polymorphism and divergence in the non-coding portion of the
    human genome yields crucial information about factors driving the evolution of
    gene regulation. Candidate cis-regulatory regions spanning more than 15,000 genes
    in 15 African Americans and 20 European Americans were re-sequenced and aligned
    to the chimpanzee genome in order to identify potentially functional polymorphism
    and to characterize and quantify departures from neutral evolution. Distortions
    of the site frequency spectra suggest a general pattern of selective constraint
    on conserved non-coding sites in the flanking regions of genes (CNCs). Moreover,
    there is an excess of fixed differences that cannot be explained by a Gamma model
    of deleterious fitness effects, suggesting the presence of positive selection
    on CNCs. Extensions of the McDonald-Kreitman test identified candidate cis-regulatory
    regions with high probabilities of positive and negative selection near many known
    human genes, the biological characteristics of which exhibit genome-wide trends
    that differ from patterns observed in protein-coding regions. Notably, there is
    a higher probability of positive selection in candidate cis-regulatory regions
    near genes expressed in the fetal brain, suggesting that a larger portion of adaptive
    regulatory changes has occurred in genes expressed during brain development. Overall
    we find that natural selection has played an important role in the evolution of
    candidate cis-regulatory regions throughout hominid evolution.

- abstract: The imprints of domestication and breed development on the genomes of
    livestock likely differ from those of companion animals. A deep draft sequence
    assembly of shotgun reads from a single Hereford female and comparative sequences
    sampled from six additional breeds were used to develop probes to interrogate
    37,470 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 497 cattle from 19 geographically
    and biologically diverse breeds. These data show that cattle have undergone a
    rapid recent decrease in effective population size from a very large ancestral
    population, possibly due to bottlenecks associated with domestication, selection,
    and breed formation. Domestication and artificial selection appear to have left
    detectable signatures of selection within the cattle genome, yet the current levels
    of diversity within breeds are at least as great as exists within humans.

- abstract: 'This article introduces a new forward population genetic simulation program
    that can efficiently generate samples from populations with complex demographic
    histories under various models of natural selection. The program (SFS_CODE) is
    highly flexible, allowing the user to simulate realistic genomic regions with
    several loci evolving according to a variety of mutation models (from simple to

    annotated as either coding or non-coding, sex-linked or autosomal, selected or
    neutral, and have an arbitrary linkage structure (from completely linked to independent).
    AVAILABILITY: The source code (written in the C programming language) is available

- abstract: Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising mutations
    in the human genome is key to resolving important debates in medical and evolutionary
    genetics. Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single
    Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic
    history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding
    SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals
    (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative
    contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation
    in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the
    sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample
    with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find
    strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid
    replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent
    with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal)
    peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29% of amino acid changing
    (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (|s|<0.01%), 30-42% are
    moderately deleterious (0.01%<|s|<1%), and nearly all the remainder are highly
    deleterious or lethal (|s|>1%). Our results are consistent with 10-20% of amino
    acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive
    selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our
    analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association
    mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying
    that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by
    this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.

  title: Assessing the evolutionary impact of amino acid mutations in the human genome.
  year: 2008
- abstract: Quantifying the number of deleterious mutations per diploid human genome
    is of crucial concern to both evolutionary and medical geneticists. Here we combine
    genome-wide polymorphism data from PCR-based exon resequencing, comparative genomic
    data across mammalian species, and protein structure predictions to estimate the
    number of functionally consequential single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) carried
    by each of 15 African American (AA) and 20 European American (EA) individuals.
    We find that AAs show significantly higher levels of nucleotide heterozygosity
    than do EAs for all categories of functional SNPs considered, including synonymous,
    non-synonymous, predicted 'benign', predicted 'possibly damaging' and predicted
    'probably damaging' SNPs. This result is wholly consistent with previous work
    showing higher overall levels of nucleotide variation in African populations than
    in Europeans. EA individuals, in contrast, have significantly more genotypes homozygous
    for the derived allele at synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs and for the damaging
    allele at 'probably damaging' SNPs than AAs do. For SNPs segregating only in one
    population or the other, the proportion of non-synonymous SNPs is significantly
    higher in the EA sample (55.4%) than in the AA sample (47.0%; P < 2.3 x 10(-37)).
    We observe a similar proportional excess of SNPs that are inferred to be 'probably
    damaging' (15.9% in EA; 12.1% in AA; P < 3.3 x 10(-11)). Using extensive simulations,
    we show that this excess proportion of segregating damaging alleles in Europeans
    is probably a consequence of a bottleneck that Europeans experienced at about
    the time of the migration out of Africa.

  title: Proportionally more deleterious genetic variation in European than in African
    populations.
  year: 2008
- abstract: Understanding the proximate and ultimate causes underlying the evolution
    of nucleotide composition in mammalian genomes is of fundamental interest to the
    study of molecular evolution. Comparative genomics studies have revealed that
    many more substitutions occur from G and C nucleotides to A and T nucleotides
    than the reverse, suggesting that mammalian genomes are not at equilibrium for
    base composition. Analysis of human polymorphism data suggests that mutations
    that increase GC-content tend to be at much higher frequencies than those that
    decrease or preserve GC-content when the ancestral allele is inferred via parsimony
    using the chimpanzee genome. These observations have been interpreted as evidence
    for a fixation bias in favor of G and C alleles due to either positive natural
    selection or biased gene conversion. Here, we test the robustness of this interpretation
    to violations of the parsimony assumption using a data set of 21,488 noncoding
    single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered by the National Institute of
    Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) SNPs project via direct resequencing of
    n = 95 individuals. Applying standard nonparametric and parametric population
    genetic approaches, we replicate the signatures of a fixation bias in favor of
    G and C alleles when the ancestral base is assumed to be the base found in the
    chimpanzee outgroup. However, upon taking into account the probability of misidentifying
    the ancestral state of each SNP using a context-dependent mutation model, the
    corrected distribution of SNP frequencies for GC-content increasing SNPs are nearly
    indistinguishable from the patterns observed for other types of mutations, suggesting
    that the signature of fixation bias is a spurious artifact of the parsimony assumption.

- abstract: Domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the oldest domesticated
    crop species in the world, having fed more people than any other plant in human
    history. We report the patterns of DNA sequence variation in rice and its wild
    ancestor, O. rufipogon, across 111 randomly chosen gene fragments, and use these
    to infer the evolutionary dynamics that led to the origins of rice. There is a
    genome-wide excess of high-frequency derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
    in O. sativa varieties, a pattern that has not been reported for other crop species.
    We developed several alternative models to explain contemporary patterns of polymorphisms
    in rice, including a (i) selectively neutral population bottleneck model, (ii)
    bottleneck plus migration model, (iii) multiple selective sweeps model, and (iv)
    bottleneck plus selective sweeps model. We find that a simple bottleneck model,
    which has been the dominant demographic model for domesticated species, cannot
    explain the derived nucleotide polymorphism site frequency spectrum in rice. Instead,
    a bottleneck model that incorporates selective sweeps, or a more complex demographic
    model that includes subdivision and gene flow, are more plausible explanations
    for patterns of variation in domesticated rice varieties. If selective sweeps
    are indeed the explanation for the observed nucleotide data of domesticated rice,
    it suggests that strong selection can leave its imprint on genome-wide polymorphism
    patterns, contrary to expectations that selection results only in a local signature
    of variation.

  title: Genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism in domesticated rice.

- abstract: Population genetic analyses often use polymorphism data from one species,
    and orthologous genomic sequences from closely related outgroup species. These
    outgroup sequences are frequently used to identify ancestral alleles at segregating
    sites and to compare the patterns of polymorphism and divergence. Inherent in
    such studies is the assumption of parsimony, which posits that the ancestral state
    of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the allele that matches the orthologous
    site in the outgroup sequence, and that all nucleotide substitutions between species
    have been observed. This study tests the effect of violating the parsimony assumption
    when mutation rates vary across sites and over time. Using a context-dependent
    mutation model that accounts for elevated mutation rates at CpG dinucleotides,
    increased propensity for transitional versus transversional mutations, as well
    as other directional and contextual mutation biases estimated along the human
    lineage, we show (using both simulations and a theoretical model) that enough
    unobserved substitutions could have occurred since the divergence of human and
    chimpanzee to cause many statistical tests to spuriously reject neutrality. Moreover,
    using both the chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genomes to parsimoniously identify
    ancestral states causes a large fraction of the data to be removed while not completely
    alleviating problem. By constructing a novel model of the context-dependent mutation
    process, we can correct polymorphism data for the effect of ancestral misidentification
    using a single outgroup.

- abstract: The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is an abundant primate species that
    diverged from the ancestors of Homo sapiens about 25 million years ago. Because
    they are genetically and physiologically similar to humans, rhesus monkeys are
    the most widely used nonhuman primate in basic and applied biomedical research.
    We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and
    compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral
    primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific
    expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual
    animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity. The complete
    description of the macaque genome blueprint enhances the utility of this animal
    model for biomedical research and improves our understanding of the basic biology
    of the species.

  title: Evolutionary and biomedical insights from the rhesus macaque genome.
  year: 2007
- abstract: The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is an abundant primate species that
    diverged from the ancestors of Homo sapiens about 25 million years ago. Because
    they are genetically and physiologically similar to humans, rhesus monkeys are
    the most widely used nonhuman primate in basic and applied biomedical research.
    We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and
    compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral
    primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific
    expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual
    animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity. The complete
    description of the macaque genome blueprint enhances the utility of this animal
    model for biomedical research and improves our understanding of the basic biology
    of the species.

  title: Evolutionary and biomedical insights from the rhesus macaque genome.
  year: 2007
- abstract: To understand the demographic history of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)
    and document the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome, we partially
    resequenced five Encyclopedia of DNA Elements regions in 9 Chinese and 38 captive-born
    Indian rhesus macaques. Population genetic analyses of the 1467 single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms discovered suggest that the two populations separated about 162,000
    years ago, with the Chinese population tripling in size since then and the Indian
    population eventually shrinking by a factor of four. Using coalescent simulations,
    we confirmed that these inferred demographic events explain a much faster decay
    of LD in Chinese (r(2) approximately 0.15 at 10 kilobases) versus Indian (r(2)
    approximately 0.52 at 10 kilobases) macaque populations.

  title: Demographic histories and patterns of linkage disequilibrium in Chinese and
    Indian rhesus macaques.
  year: 2007
- abstract: Comparisons of DNA polymorphism within species to divergence between species
    enables the discovery of molecular adaptation in evolutionarily constrained genes
    as well as the differentiation of weak from strong purifying selection. The extent
    to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular
    evolution of different species varies greatly, with some species, such as Drosophila
    melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection, and others,
    such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious
    variation within local populations. Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence
    polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes
    to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural
    selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis
    discovered 304 (9.0%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence
    of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5%) out of 6,033 potentially
    informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees,
    indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations
    at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected
    genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that
    some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving
    genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes
    with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid
    divergence between humans and chimpanzees.

  title: Natural selection on protein-coding genes in the human genome.
  year: 2005
- abstract: Natural selection and demographic forces can have similar effects on patterns
    of DNA polymorphism. Therefore, to infer selection from samples of DNA sequences,
    one must simultaneously account for demographic effects. Here we take a model-based
    approach to this problem by developing predictions for patterns of polymorphism
    in the presence of both population size change and natural selection. If data
    are available from different functional classes of variation, and a priori information
    suggests that mutations in one of those classes are selectively neutral, then
    the putatively neutral class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and
    inferences regarding selection on other classes can be performed given demographic
    parameter estimates. This procedure is more robust to assumptions regarding the
    true underlying demography than previous approaches to detecting and analyzing
    selection. We apply this method to a large polymorphism data set from 301 human
    genes and find (i) widespread negative selection acting on standing nonsynonymous
    variation, (ii) that the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations are well predicted
    by several measures of amino acid exchangeability, especially site-specific methods,
    and (iii) strong evidence for very recent population growth.
