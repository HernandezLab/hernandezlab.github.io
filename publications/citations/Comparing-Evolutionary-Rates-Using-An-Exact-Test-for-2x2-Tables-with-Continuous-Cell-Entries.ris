N2  - Assessing the statistical significance of an observed 2x2 contingency 
      table can easily be accomplished using Fisher's exact test (FET). 
      However, if the cell entries are continuous or represent values inferred 
      from a continuous parametric model, then FET cannot be applied. Such 
      tables arise frequently in areas of biostatistical research including 
      population genetics and evolutionary genomics, where cell entries are 
      estimated by computational methods and result in cell entries drawn from 
      the non-negative real line R+. Simply rounding cell entries to conform 
      to the assumptions of FET is an ill-suited approach that we show creates 
      problems related to both type-I and type-II errors. Pearson's chi^2 test 
      for independence, while technically applicable, is not often effective 
      for these tables, as the test has several limiting assumptions that make 
      application of this method inadvisable in many common instances 
      (particularly with small cell entries). Here we develop a novel method 
      for tables with continuous entries, which we term continuous Fisher's 
      Exact Test (cFET). Through simulations, we show that cFET has a 
      close-to-uniform distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis of 
      independence, and more power when applied to tables where the null 
      hypothesis is false (compared to FET applied to rounded cell entries). 
      We apply cFET to an example from comparative genomics to confirm an 
      overall increased evolutionary rate among primates compared to rodents, 
      and identify several genes that show particularly elevated evolutionary 
      rates in primates. Some of these genes exhibit signatures of continued 
      positive selection along the human lineage since our divergence with 
      chimpanzee 5-7 million years ago, as well as ongoing selection in modern 
      humans.
