Kevin received his bachelors degree from the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) in Chemical Engineering. Following that, he worked in the biofuels industry for two years on scale up and validation microorganisms to produce fuel from renewable sources. His research will focus on developing tools to derive knowledge from population-level genomic and other sequencing data. Specifically, he will make use evolutionary metrics to better understand pathology of disease.
