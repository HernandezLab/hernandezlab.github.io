## Ryan Hernandez

Principal Investigator

I study patterns of genetic variation in modern day populations to gain insight into their evolutionary history. My focus is on the development of population genetic models that can best explain observed data. Most recently, I have been evaluating models of background selection under parameters that are realistic for humans. My scientific approach tends to be highly computational, often involving a thorough analysis of detailed simulations.

## Postdoctoral Scholars

### Zachary Szpiech

I completed my BS in mathematics at the University if Michigan and my PhD in Bioinformatics with Noah Rosenberg. I study the properties and distribution of private genetic variation, its role in the inference of population demography, and its connections to admixture mapping and complex disease genetics.

## Graduate Students

### Nicolas Strauli

Nicolas is interested in observing evolution take place in real-time. The purpose of this is two fold: (1) To use real-time evolution as a platform to test population genetics theory. (2) To gain knowledge about how quickly reproducing pathogens (or comensals) evolve in their host environment. Currently, he is working on a project that is addressing the question of how a single, genetically static human is able to fend off whole populations of quickly evolving pathogens. The answer clearly lies in the vast complexity of our immune systems, but with modern genetic sequencing technologies, we are only now able to address it. He plans to observe how a mouse's antibody repertoire, as well as the population of a pathogen, changes during the course of an infection.

### Raul Torres

I am a graduate student in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program. I have undergraduate degrees in biology and anthropology and worked at the University of Chicago in the lab of Dr. Carole Ober. There, I worked to identify mitochondrial variants associated with preeclampsia in African Americans. I am broadly interested in understanding patterns of demography and natural selection in the human genome and how such patterns contribute to variation within and between different human populations.

### Kevin Hartman

Kevin is a graduate student in Bioinformatics at UCSF. He received his bachelors degree from the California Institute of Technology in Chemical Engineering. Following that, he worked in the biofuels industry for two years on scale up and validation of biocatalysts. His research will focus on developing tools to derive knowledge from population-level genomic and other sequencing data. Specifically, he will make use evolutionary metrics to better understand pathology of disease.

### Melissa Spear

### Dominic Tong

Dominic did his undergraduate work at the University of British Columbia in Engineering Physics, a mix of electrical engineering and applied physics. He then continued his insanity and started his Bioengineering PhD work with Dr. Ryan Hernandez at UCSF, primarily focused on the role of rare variants in determining complex phenotypes and how to use that information in diagnostics. In his spare time, Dominic likes to hike to the tops of things, build electromechanical trinkets of varying utility, and in the very near future, forge a sword.
