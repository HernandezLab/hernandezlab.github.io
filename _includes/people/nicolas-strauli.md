Nicolas is interested in observing evolution take place in real-time. The
purpose of this is two fold: (1) To use real-time evolution as a platform to
test population genetics theory. (2) To gain knowledge about how quickly
reproducing pathogens (or comensals) evolve in their host environment.
Currently, he is working on a project that is addressing the question of how a
single, genetically static human is able to fend off whole populations of
quickly evolving pathogens. The answer clearly lies in the vast complexity of
our immune systems, but with modern genetic sequencing technologies, we are
only now able to address it. He plans to observe how a mouse's antibody
repertoire, as well as the population of a pathogen, changes during the course
of an infection.
