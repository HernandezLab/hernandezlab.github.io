Zachary completed a BS in mathematics at the University of Michigan and stayed
to earn a PhD in Bioinformatics with Noah Rosenberg. He studies how patterns of
genetic variation respond to population-level processes including demography,
selection, and social behaviors.  Through rigorous theoretical, computational,
and analytical work, his research seeks to learn about the natural history of
populations and the genetic basis of complex phenotypes.  His research extends
across basic and applied sciences with relevance in diverse fields from
anthropology to medicine.
