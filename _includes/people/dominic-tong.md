Dominic did his undergraduate work at the University of British Columbia in
Engineering Physics, a mix of electrical engineering and applied physics. He
then continued his insanity and started his Bioengineering PhD work with Dr.
Ryan Hernandez at UCSF, primarily focused on the role of rare variants in
determining complex phenotypes and how to use that information in diagnostics.
In his spare time, Dominic likes to hike to the tops of things, build
electromechanical trinkets of varying utility, and in the very near future,
forge a sword.
