I am a graduate student in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program. I have
undergraduate degrees in biology and anthropology and worked at the University
of Chicago in the lab of Dr. Carole Ober. There, I worked to identify
mitochondrial variants associated with preeclampsia in African Americans. I am
broadly interested in understanding patterns of demography and natural
selection in the human genome and how such patterns contribute to variation
within and between different human populations.
