Kevin received his bachelors degree from the [California Institute of
Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) in Chemical Engineering. Following that,
he worked in the biofuels industry for two years on scale up and validation
microorganisms to produce fuel from renewable sources. His research will focus
on developing tools to derive knowledge from population-level genomic and
other sequencing data. Specifically, he will make use of evolutionary metrics
to better understand pathology of disease.
